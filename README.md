Sum of pairs - [Purelyfunctional.tv - Issue 401 weekly challenge](https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-401-design-is-not-about-ease-of-change/)

## This weekâ€™s challenge

Write a function that takes a collection of numbers and a target number. Return all pairs of numbers found in the collection that sum up to the target number.

Examples

(sums-of-pairs [2 4 5 6] 8) ;=> [[2 6]]
(sums-of-pairs [3 2 0 1 1 5] 5) ;=> [[2 3] [0 5]]
(sums-of-pairs [1 3 2 3 4 5] 7) ;=> [[3 4] [3 4]]
Notes

There can be duplicate numbers and hence duplicate pairs.
Each pair should be sorted.
